# Advanced Configuration

Ready to take your ActiveRecord skills to the next level? Let's explore how you can leverage `LiteRecord` for advanced
implementations like validations, callbacks, and custom filters. Get ready to work some magic with your code!

## Validations and Callbacks

`LiteRecord` allows you to define callbacks to execute actions at specific points in a model's lifecycle. Want to
validate data before saving or log audits after an operation? You can do that!

### Validation Example with a Callback

To validate a product before saving it, define a method called `_beforeSave`.

```php
class Product extends LiteRecord
{
    protected static $table = 'products';

    // Callback before saving
    protected function _beforeSave()
    {
        if ($this->price <= 0) {
            // Do not allow negative or zero prices
            return false;
        }
        return true;  // Proceed with the operation
    }
}

// Usage example
$product = new Product();
$product->name = 'Incorrect Product';
$product->price = -50.00;

if (!$product->save()) {
    echo "The product could not be saved due to a negative price.";
}
```

## Custom Search Filters

Need to implement advanced searches or pagination? `LiteRecord` has you covered with custom SQL queries to efficiently
filter data.

### Filter Example

To search for products within a price range, create a method in the model:

```php
class Product extends LiteRecord
{
    protected static $table = 'products';

    // Custom method to filter by price range
    public static function filterByPrice(float $min, float $max): array
    {
        $sql = "WHERE price BETWEEN ? AND ?";
        return static::filter($sql, [$min, $max]);
    }
}

// Usage example
$products = Product::filterByPrice(10.00, 100.00);
foreach ($products as $product) {
    echo $product->name . " costs " . $product->price . PHP_EOL;
}
```

## Transaction Management

Want to ensure that a series of operations are performed atomically? `LiteRecord` makes it easy to work with
transactions, ensuring data consistency.

```php
try {
    LiteRecord::begin();

    $product1 = Product::get(1);
    $product1->price = 90.00;
    $product1->update();

    $product2 = Product::get(2);
    $product2->price = 80.00;
    $product2->update();

    LiteRecord::commit();  // Confirm the transaction
} catch (Exception $e) {
    LiteRecord::rollback();  // Rollback if an error occurs
    echo "Error during the transaction: " . $e->getMessage();
}
```

And there you have it! With these advanced configurations, you are ready to handle any challenge that comes your way. If
